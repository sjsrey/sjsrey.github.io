Back in 2006, [Luc Anselin](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directory/luc-anselin-phd) and I put together a special issue on
[Recent Advances in Software for Spatial Analysis in the Social Sciences](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0016-7363.2005.00670.x) for 
[Geographical Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15384632).

Today, I'm happy to announce the publication of a new special issue that takes a look at what has changed in the last 15 (or so) years. 

Spoiler alert - *a lot* has changed. To learn more, click below:
