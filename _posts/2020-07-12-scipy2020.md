Had a great time giving a tutorial with [Eli Knaap](http://knaaptime.com) at [SciPy 2020](https://www.scipy2020.scipy.org/) on using PySAL for spatial data science. This year was completely virtual, which is quite a change from interacting in person with the participants. On the upside, the use of the chat system allowed for more of the audience questions to be handled. The feedback was very positive and it appears the audience had as much fun as we did.


The tutorial materials are available on [github](https://github.com/knaaptime/pysal-scipy20), or you can explore the materials live via [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/knaaptime/pysal-scipy20/master)
