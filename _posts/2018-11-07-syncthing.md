Having dealt with one-too-many all day sync marathons when setting up a new machine, I've been looking for ways to get off of Dropbox. Additionally, it has now been over 2 years since I switched from vim to emacs, due in large part to [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), and I've been using [orgzly](https://orgmode.org/) on the pixel to sync my files. This was inconsistent, at best, and at worst, would often result in conflicts and a reset of the database on the pixel. No bueno.

So for the past week or so I've been exploring [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). Haven't noticed any sync conflicts between orgzly and the laptops/desktops so this is promising. I am thinking about moving all my dropbox folders into this. Stay tuned.
