I am founding director of the [Center for Open Geographical Science](http://cogs.sdsu.edu) and [Professor of Geography](https://geography.sdsu.edu/people/bios/rey) at San Diego State University.


My research interests are in geographic information science, spatial inequality dynamics, regional science, spatial econometrics, and spatial data science.

This research  significantly benefits from, and contributes to, open source software and the practice of open science.

You can hit the links above to learn more about these things, or check out my ramblings on [the blog](/).
